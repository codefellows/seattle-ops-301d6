# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn't be a problem. It's important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to schedule a "practice run" of your presentation.

Plan for a 45-60 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team. During the practice presentation, the instructional team will provide constructive feedback about the flow of the presentation and technical demo.

Your team should practice the presentation prior to rehearsals with the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
  - Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
  - When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the "audience" / camera.
  - Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel. Remember, "Your smiles can be heard over the phone"

Why:

If there are any issues in your final product's functionality, it is better to catch them ahead of time. This is also an opportunity to view the technical demonstration as it will be shared with the audience. Evaluate any screen size issues, color changes due if you are projecting, and overall impact on the user's experience. The practice round will also allow the team to work on the flow of the presentation as speaking roles are passed from one member to another.

Decide whose computer to use during the presentation and have that computer fully ready for practice session. Make sure you have any cables or adaptors needed, and know what settings are needed to share your screen (and audio, if relevant). Test this computer as the driver of the presentation BEFORE your practice. Test a backup computer as well, just in case.

The appropriate dress code is business casual - not too formal and not too casual.

In addition to the scheduled practice session, the team is encouraged to continue to practice on their own. Keep track of the time and adjust accordingly. Practice with the microphone (muting / unmuting, or holding something if in-person) to feel comfortable with it, and practice passing the microphone between team members as you switch speaking roles if in-person.

Speak clearly and do not use slang or profanity. Take it seriously and be professional.

## Deliverable

Start a new Google Doc, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.
  - Name the doc “ops-201d# Team# Team Agreement”
    - Replace “#” with your cohort number and team number/name.
  - Add team members to the “People with access” category with “Editor” privileges, using their gmail address.
  - Format your Google Doc to be pageless.
    - File > Page Setup > Pageless > OK
    - Click on the margin’s bar top/left side
    - Hover over Text Width
    - Select Full
  - List all team members full names at the top of the doc.
  - Copy and paste the questions into your Google Doc under appropriately named headers.
    - Each team member will record their response for every prompt.
  - Please make any additions that best fit the needs of your team.

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:
  - What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

> NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:
  - What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:
  - What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, Discord ...)?
  - How often will you take breaks?
  - What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?
  - How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. This should prevent "lone wolf" efforts and "siloed" efforts.

> NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, building or making changes to the project infrastructure on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:
  - How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - What project management tool will be used?

## Git Process

Plan out what your team's Git workflow looks like for scripting tasks.

Describe at least:
  - What components of your project will be recorded in a Google Doc?
  - What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - How will you structure the GitHub organization and the repos inside of it?
  - How will you share the organization and the repositories with your teammates?
  - What is your Git flow? How will you commit your work to GitHub?

## Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone's name at the top of the Google Doc.

Share your Google Doc so that "Anyone with the link can comment" in the submission field below.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
