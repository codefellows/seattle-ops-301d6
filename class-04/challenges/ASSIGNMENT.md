# Ops Challenge: Conditionals in Menu Systems

## Overview

Conditionals allow us to program a process to react differently based on various object states. A conditional statement will make use of the IF, THEN keywords to trigger actions in the script depending on whether the test was passed. Conditionals are highly useful in evaluating user input, and thereby letting us setup responsive menu systems in our tooling.

> Think of the last time you stopped at an intersection. Why did you stop? There was probably a stop sign or stop light. The logic would be something like "IF I see a stop light OR stop sign, THEN I will stop the car. ELSE, I'll just drive on through."

## Resources

- [Bash conditional statement](https://linuxhint.com/bash_conditional_statement/){:target="_blank"} 

## Objectives

- Create a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options:
  - Hello world (prints "Hello world!" to the screen)
  - Ping self (pings this computer's loopback address)
  - IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)
  - Exit
- Next, the user input should be requested.
- The program should next use a conditional statement to evaluate the user's input, then act according to what the user selected.
- Use a loop to bring up the menu again after the request has been executed.
