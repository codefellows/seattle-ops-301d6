# [Template] SOP:

## Purpose:

> [The purpose or rational for the procedure. If there are policies or standards which this procedure exists to meet, reference them here.]

This document will answer the question "How will you write and organize your SOPs?" while also serving as an example of the format.

## Scope:

[What areas of the organization will be affected.]

## Responsibilities:

> [Who is responsible for implementing, following, reviewing, maintaining, and updating this policy.]

## Prerequisites:

> [The information, resources, permissions, etc. required to execute this procedure.]

## Procedure:

> [The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of its implementation might change.]

- Begin with a flow chart map of the parts of the procedure being defined. This will become your outline
- Bundle closely related tasks together for concision, especially if they always occur together/in sequence without much deviation
- Work to have 5-7 tasks -- too few and it's not worth reading; too many and it's too hard to read. This is about parsing.
- Now revise the flowchart to match the way you have bundled steps and number each steps
- Write a concise, focused description for each step
- Add a brief opening overview paragraph to describe the topic , inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles
