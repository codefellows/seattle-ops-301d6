# Domain Controller

## Overview

During deployment of Windows Server one of the first steps is to assign it the correct roles and be promote it to DC (Domain Controller). Once promoted, the DC can not only facilitate centralized identity management with AD (Active Directory), but can also allow the systems administrator to "push" standardized configurations to Windows endpoints using GPOs (Group Policy Objects). Growing companies and enterprises alike will utilize these Windows Server features in order to more effectively administer endpoints at scale.
