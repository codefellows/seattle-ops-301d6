# Ops Challenge: Python Conditional Statements

## Overview

Conditionals are an important tool in any language and see plenty of use in Python. The ability to influence a computer system's decision making process based on value comparisons is powerful and an essential ingredient in most programming languages. Today, you will be using "if statements" in Python.

## Objectives

Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include `elif` keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.

Create an if statement that includes both `elif` and `else` to execute when both `if` and `elif` are not met.

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

Create an if statement with two conditions by using `and` between conditions.

Create an if statement with two conditions by using `or` between conditions.

Create a nested if statement.

Create an if statement that includes `pass` to avoid errors.

## Submission Instructions
