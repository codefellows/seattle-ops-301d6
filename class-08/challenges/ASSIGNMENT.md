# Ops Challenge: Python Collections

## Overview

Python is known for its relevance to data science and consequently handles data quite well using array. A fundamental grasp of data structures and algorithms will help you a great deal in feeling comfortable with these concepts during an intense job interview for a position where you'll be automating tedious processes for the company. Today, you will be working with lists in Python.

## Objectives

Create a Python script that includes the following:

- Assign to a variable a list of ten string elements.
- Print the fourth element of the list.
- Print the sixth through tenth element of the list.
- Change the value of the seventh element to "onion".

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

Use the below Python methods once each against your list to manipulate the elements in your list:

```python
append()
clear()
copy()
count()
extend()
index()
insert()
pop()
remove()
reverse()
sort()
```

Create one tuple.
Create one set.
Create one dictionary.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, ACP it from VS Code to your **public** [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your course code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your GitHub file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
  - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
  - How long you spent working on this assignment
