# Ops Challenge: Python Requests Library

## Overview

Ever wondered how web browsers like Google Chrome communicate with web servers to create the interactive web sites and apps we use every day? One technical answer is HTTP requests. Today, you will be performing HTTP `GET` requests using the `requests` Python library. This library is very useful for a security professional to evaluate how a web server responds to outside requests.
