# Group Project: Map Project Requirements

## Project Scope
Project Scope

Determine which features make up your minimum viable product (MVP). This should include any features you absolutely need to have in your infrastructure for presentation day.

Why:
> Scope creep can be dangerous! Keeping your project within a pre-determined scope will help the group stay on task without going off on tangents and side tasks.

Continue working in your team’s System Selection document and list out the MVP tasks necessary for presentation day and deliverables due at the end of Project Week.

Beyond MVP, put together a list of stretch goals to tackle if you have time.

## Project Management

For this assignment, populate the project management tool you chose in Prep #3 with the below information.

- Project deliverables grouped by milestone.
- All project tasks, due dates, and assignments.
- Stretch goals (objectives to achieve if time allows).

Reference the Project Guidelines for specific project requirements.

Grant the instructor access to your project management tool for review during daily stand-ups.

## System Diagrams

Create some initial diagrams of any aspects of your solution that you can plan at this stage. Examples include topologies, network diagrams and process flow charts.

Link these assets in your GitHub Documentation repo for review during daily stand-ups.

## SOPs

Fill in your PM Tool with SOPs that need to be written, then evenly distribute the SOPS to different team members to complete.

- For each SOP included in your MSP SOW deliverable, attribute authorship to the team member.
- SOPs can either be:
  - Worked on as Google Docs and committed as PDFs in the documentation repo on the GitHub Org.
  - Worked on and committed as Markdown files in the documentation repo on the GitHub Org.

## Submission Instructions
This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Share the link to your team’s GitHub Org in the submission field below.

Upon completion of your tasks listed above, notify your instructor for approval of the content. After approval, you may begin working on your solutions. All 4 project assignments must be completed before you may start your project.
