# Prepare for Projects: Systems Selection Document

This project will require you to demonstrate skills you've learned so far in the course.

## Deliverable

Start a new Google Doc, and include the following components in your system selection submission.
  - Name the doc “ops-201d# Team# System Selection”
    - Replace “#” with your cohort number and team number/name.
  - Add team members to the “People with access” category with “Editor” privileges, using their gmail address.
  - Format your Google Doc to be pageless.
    - File > Page Setup > Pageless > OK
    - Click on the margin’s bar top/left side
    - Hover over Text Width
    - Select Full
  - List all team members full names at the top of the doc.
  - Copy and paste your team’s scenario into the doc with a header.

<!-- ## Scenario

- [201 Scenario](./scenarios/201-scenario.md)
- 301 Scenario
- 401 Scenario

## Project Requirements

Your instructor will provide the project guidelines and send you the scenario unique to your team. Some aspects of the project are left up to you to decide how to approach.

- [201 Project Requirements](./project-requirements/201-project-requirements.md)
- [301 Project Requirements](./project-requirements/301-project-requirements.md)
- [401 Midterm Project Requirements](./project-requirements/401-midterm-project-requirements.md)
- [401 Final Project Requirements](./project-requirements/401-final-project-requirements.md) -->

## Systems Selection

Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you'll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.

Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’re going to implement for your client. For each, explain:

1. How does it fit into your scenario's requirements?
1. What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?
  - Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.
1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
  - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project. Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.

Once you are ready, find your instructor and pitch your solution ideas.

## Submitting your work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone's name at the top of the Google Doc.

Share your Google Doc so that "Anyone with the link can comment" in the submission field below.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
