## Course Description

Gain hands-on server and networking skills in this exciting course that follows the journey of the fictional GlobeX Corporation as it grows from a startup to a multinational enterprise with fully-functional network and information systems. As their new administrator, get ready to deploy systems and design new networks in this fast-paced learning environment that mirrors critical on-the-job scenarios designed to prepare you for real-world Ops challenges.

The course integrates practical network and systems administration operations such as network design and troubleshooting, VPN tunneling, firewall configuration, network security, server deployment and configuration, user identity management, scripting & automation, and system health monitoring with professional exercises in change management and project planning in a simulated on-the-job narrative.

## Certification

This course will substantially prepare students for achieving the learning objectives of CompTIA Network+ certification. This course covers significant aspects of four of the five domains required for Network+.

CompTIA Network+

- 1.0 Networking Concepts
- 2.0 Infrastructure
- 3.0 Network Operations
- 5.0 Network Troubleshooting and Tools

> Students register for the CompTIA Network+ during course prework, and are asked to take the exam during the final module. The studentâ€™s resulting score from taking CompTIA Network+ is then factored into the final grade for this course. Passing this course is largely contingent upon passing CompTIA Network+.
