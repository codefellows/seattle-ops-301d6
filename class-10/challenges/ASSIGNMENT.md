# Ops Challenge: Python File Handling

## Overview

Today, you will be using Python's file handling capabilities to open and manipulate an existing file. This can be useful in generating log files or working with CSV or JSON data files.

## Objectives

Using file handling commands, create a Python script that creates a new .txt file, appends three lines, prints to the screen the first line, then deletes the .txt file.

## Stretch Goal

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Export your pfSense configuration. 
- Have your Python script open the exported file. 
- Code up your script to change a value inside the file. 
- Save the changes out to a new file name.
- Re-import the modified configuraiton file, to verify that your changes will be accepted by pfSense.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, ACP it from VS Code to your **public** [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your course code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your GitHub file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
  - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
  - How long you spent working on this assignment
