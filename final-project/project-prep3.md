# GitHub Organization and PM Tooling

# Deliverable

Each group should create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repositories there. Don't forget to customize everyone's permissions so that all team members are an "Admin".

The name of the org and the repo should be resume-ready. Use the the problem domain or another professional-sounding team name. Don't call it 201Final or project-week or reeses-puffs or similar.

> This project may well be a key piece of your resume. Potential employers will be looking at this project and it’s documentation. Name it accordingly.

Then build the repos:

1. Create a repo to link the Team Agreement doc, System Selection doc, topologies/visuals, SOP docs and the slideshow.
  - Create a basic README.md file within this repo that contains the names of all the members as well as a description of the project.
  - The README.md file should be attractively formatted and include links to each of your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
  - Link the PM tool your team is using to manage tasks.
  - On this README.md file, label and link all SOPs.
    - For each SOP included in your MSP SOW deliverable, attribute authorship to the team member.
    - SOPs can either be:
      - Worked on as Google Docs and committed as PDFs.
      - Worked on and committed as Markdown files.
  - Commit topology images and other visuals to the repo and link them on the README.md file.
  - Include any relevant information required for the operation of the demonstrated system.
    - Any config files which you created or customized, exported in an appropriate format (such as json)
  - When completed, export the slide deck as a PDF, commit it to the repo and link it to the README.md file.
  - When it becomes available, link the recording of your presentation.
2. Create any additional repos for each individual script.
  - Create a basic README.md file within the repo that contains the names of all the members and a description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.
    - Please list any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.
  - Commit the script in it’s own file and link it to the README.md file.
    - Don’t forget to leave comments in your code!

## Project Management Tool

Make sure everyone, including your grader and the audience, has access and correct permissions to the tool you are using. Link your Project Management tool in the documentation repo on GitHub.

Please use one of these tools listed below:

- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){:target="_blank"}
- [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) Projects{:target="_blank"}

Build out sections to help organize tasks. Try using labels such as “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done” and “Stretch Goals”. Organize your PM Tool however you think is best for your team!

## Systems Selection

Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you'll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.

Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’re going to implement for your client. For each, explain:

1. How does it fit into your scenario's requirements?
1. What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?
  - Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.
1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
  - What is the minimum required for you to present on demo day?

During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project. Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.

Once you are ready, find your instructor and pitch your solution ideas.
