## Objectives

Create a bash script that:
- Copies `/var/log/syslog` to the current working directory
- Appends the current date and time to the filename

For shell scripts, format your code according to the shell style guide linked above.

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Include in your bash script some timestamped echo statements telling the user what is happening at each stage of the script.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, ACP it from VS Code to your **public** [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your course code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your GitHub file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
