# Ops Challenge: Conditionals in Menu Systems

## Overview

Conditionals allow us to program a process to react differently based on various object states. A conditional statement will make use of the IF, THEN keywords to trigger actions in the script depending on whether the test was passed. Conditionals are highly useful in evaluating user input, and thereby letting us setup responsive menu systems in our tooling.
