# Ops Challenge: Psutil

## Overview

Python is known for its versatile and diverse selection of libraries. Libraries are installable toolkits that add new functions to the language on your system. Today you will use Psutil to fetch system information.

## Objectives

Install Psutil.

Create a Python script that fetches this information using Psutil:

- Time spent by normal processes executing in user mode
- Time spent by processes executing in kernel mode
- Time when system was idle
- Time spent by priority processes executing in user mode
- Time spent waiting for I/O to complete.
- Time spent for servicing hardware interrupts
- Time spent for servicing software interrupts
- Time spent by other operating systems running in a virtualized environment
- Time spent running a virtual CPU for guest operating systems under the control of the Linux kernel

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Save the information to a .txt file.
- Email the .txt file to yourself using Sendmail.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, ACP it from VS Code to your **public** [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your course code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your GitHub file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
  - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
  - How long you spent working on this assignment
