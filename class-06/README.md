# Network Address Translation

## Overview

NAT (Network address translation) is a technique performed by routers whereby the IP address in a packet header is altered in transit so that the destination interprets the packet as coming from the new IP instead of the actual originating IP. NAT has played a vital role globally in delaying [IPv4 address exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion), greatly reducing the need to transition at a large scale to IPv6.
