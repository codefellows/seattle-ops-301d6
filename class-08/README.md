# RADIUS Authentication

## Overview

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a network management protocol facilitating AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) management for network users. In this type of configuration, the NAS (Network Access Server) brokers authentication requests and acts as the network's gatekeeper.
