# VPN Tunnel

## Overview

The VPN protocol can be used in several ways; everyday computer users are likely familiar with client VPN services that claim to grant privacy to their customers. Another way to use VPN is to establish a private network connection between two computers (client-server VPN). Today you'll join two separate networks using IPsec Site-to-Site VPN Tunnelling via pfSense's built-in IPsec tunnelling capabilities.
